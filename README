These are code examples for Padauk Microcontrollers.

They are meant to be compiled with the Small Device C Compiler (SDCC).

For pdk14 and pdk15, the SDCC backend is considered stable.
For pdk13, the SDCC-based toolchain is still experimental as of 2019-06-09, so running into issues is to be expected.

Currently, there are 4 demos:

* count-pfs154: A timer / LED example for the PFC154, PFC232, PFS154 and PFS173 (e.g. on the pfs154-s16 or pfc232-s16 board).

* hello-pfs154: A serial output example for the PFC154, PFC232, PFS154 and PFS173 (e.g. on the pfs154-s16 or pfc232-s16 board).

* timer_irq_blink: An example ported from MINI-C to SDCC.

* watchdog: An example ported from MINI-C to SDCC.
