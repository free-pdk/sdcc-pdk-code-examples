These are code examples for Padauk Microcontrollers.

The are meant to be compiled with the Small Device C Compiler (SDCC).

The SDCC-based toolchain is still experimental as of 2019-01-14, so even compiling these simple examples might not fully work yet, and require manual postprocessing (e.g. in relocation).
