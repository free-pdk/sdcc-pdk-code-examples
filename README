These are code examples for Padauk Microcontrollers.

They are meant to be compiled with the Small Device C Compiler (SDCC).

For pdk14 and pdk15, the SDCC backend is considered stable.
For pdk13, the SDCC-based toolchain is still experimental as of 2020-05-19, so running into issues is to be expected.

The count-pfs154 and hello-pfs154 demos have been tested using PFS154 and PFS173 on the pfs154-s16 board. Other configurations have not yet been tested.

Currently, there are 5 demos:

* count-pfc151: A timer / LED example for the PFC151, PFC154, PFC161, PFS154, PFS173 (e.g. on the pfc151-s08 board).

* count-pfs154: A timer / LED example for the PFC154, PFC232, PFS154 and PFS173 (e.g. on the pfs154-s16 or pfc232-s16 board).

* hello-pfs154: A serial output example for the PFC154, PFC232, PFS154 and PFS173 (e.g. on the pfs154-s16 or pfc232-s16 board).

* timer_irq_blink: An example ported from MINI-C to SDCC.

* watchdog: An example ported from MINI-C to SDCC.
