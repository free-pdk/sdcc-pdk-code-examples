These are code examples for Padauk Microcontrollers.

Suitable simple boards for can be found at: https://github.com/free-pdk/f-eval-boards

They are meant to be compiled with the Small Device C Compiler (SDCC), version 4.0.0 or later.

The count-s08 demo has been tested using PFS172 on the f-eval-pdk-s08 board.
The count-s08a demo has been tested using PFS154 and PFS173 on the f-eval-pdk-s08a board.
The count-s16 and hello-s16 demos have been tested using PFS154 and PFS173 on the f-eval-pdk-s16 board.
Other configurations have not yet been tested.

Currently, there are 5 demos:

* count-s08: A timer / LED example for the PFS122, PFS172, and PGS134 (e.g. on the f-eval-s08 board).

* count-s08a: A timer / LED example for the PFC151, PFC154, PFC161, PFS123, PFS154, PFS173 (e.g. on the f-eval-s08a board).

* count-s08b: A timer / LED example for the PFC161 (e.g. on the f-eval-s08b board).

* count-s16: A timer / LED example for the PFC154, PFC232, PFS132, PFS154, PFS173, PGS134, and PGS152 (e.g. on the f-eval-pdk-s16 or f-eval-pdk-s16a board).

* hello-s16: A serial output example for the PFC154, PFC232, PFS132, PFS154, PFS173, PGS134, and PGS152 (e.g. on the f-eval-pdk-s16 or f-eval-pdk-s16a board).

* timer_irq_blink: An example ported from MINI-C to SDCC.

* watchdog: An example ported from MINI-C to SDCC.
