These are code examples for Padauk Microcontrollers.

They are meant to be compiled with the Small Device C Compiler (SDCC).

For pdk14, the SDCC backend is stable.
For pdk13 and pdk15, the SDCC-based toolchain is still experimental as of 2019-04-03, so even compiling these simple examples might not fully work yet, and require manual postprocessing (e.g. in relocation).
